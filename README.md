## Browsers/Hardware Support

Initially project was intended to work with all modern browsers
that supports the [CSS Grid Layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout),
but it seems that a lot of TV screens with embeded web browsers don't support it.
This is why project aims to work with older browsers like:

* Firefox 37+
* Chrome 34+
* Edge 12+

Tested with following TV web browsers:

* Samsung Browser 1.0 on Tizen Linux

## Versioning

This project is using Semver v2.0.0.
